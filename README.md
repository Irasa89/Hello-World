# Hello-World

Version 1.0

Hello Everyone!

My name is Mattanih Gladman, and I am working towards becoming a front-end web developer.
GitHub will be the place where I will be storing my finished websites/projects, and any ideas I have for future work.

I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javacript, so these are the the of files that will be stored here

Feel free to look through my work and to leave some feedback if you want.
I am still a beginner at this, but hopefully the things I learn will be able
to help other begiiners like myself!
